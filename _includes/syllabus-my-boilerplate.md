##### Final Letter Grades
A weighted average of various assessments (see above) determines your final letter grade. Anything after the decimal point is truncated, e.g. 89.9% = B+.

| Final Average  | Letter Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 100% - 95% | A |
| 94% - 90% | A- |
| 89% - 87% | B+ |
| 86% - 84% | B |
| 83% - 80% | B- |
| 79% - 77% | C+ |
| 76% - 74% | C |
| 73% - 70% | C- |
| 69% - 67% | D+ |
| 66% - 64% | D |
| 63% - 60% | D- |
| 59% and below | F |



##### Attendance and Participation
Regular attendance and participation in class are required. Attendance, to be graded out of 10 "participation points," applies toward your final grade. I deduct **2 points** for each unexcused absence, **1 point** for being late, and **1 point** for engaging in activities that can disrupt others: scrolling through your phone, texting, playing games on your laptop, etc.

- Participation points is allowed to become negative, which will adversely impact your overall grade.

Furthermore, if a student misses more than 6 class meetings (15% of the semester) without a verified excuse or accommodation, they will be automatically withdrawn from the course (W) or assigned a failing grade (F). Exceptions may be granted for verified emergencies with appropriate documentation.

- Excused absences (e.g., medical, family emergency, etc.) may require documentation and do not count toward this limit.



##### During Class: Phones Off!
Phones are a common distraction during lectures. Please turn your phones off, or at least put your phones on silent during lecture. If you are caught using your phone during class and/or lab, it will affect your participation points.


### Academic Integrity

I adhere to the university's [academic integrity policy](https://www.pugetsound.edu/academic-integrity). If a student is caught misrepresenting their work, then  at minimum, they will receive an automatic zero for the assignment and the case will be reported upstream, which may affect the student's athletic and scholarship eligibilities. To avoid such problems, use common sense and when in doubt, ask me for advice. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Copying the work of another student or former student.
- Copying work found online or on generative AI platforms (see section below for expanded discussion into AI assistance).
- Communication of any form during exams.

##### AI Usage Policy
In select courses, I have created an "AI Tutor" that has been trained on our course materials. You can use this AI tutor freely to get help on assignments, to brainstorm, and to review for exams. If an AI Tutor has been created for this class, I will make it available through canvas. Limit your AI usage to just the provided bot, as other AI tools can lead you astray from the course materials.

Note, however, that there are clear boundaries that, when crossed, could lead to severe consequences. Here are some do's-and-don'ts on how to properly use AI for this class:
- **Do** use it to be your personal tutor. Use it to explain concepts you don't fully grasp. When helping with homework, prompt it with things like, "Without providing me with any code solution ..."
- **Do** use it to help you debug. Try pasting in your code and the errors you receive when compiling or running it. Have it comment on possible issues without simply giving you the fix -- this is how you learn to become a better programmer!
- **Do** use it to explain code to you. Is there a piece of code we went over in class that don't fully understand? Type it into the prompt, and have it explain line-by-line as well as holistically on how everything comes together.
- **Do** use it to explain any mathematics that you might need to know for an assignment or lab.
- **Don't** copy-and-paste and turn anything in that was generated by AI tools. In general, copying-and-pasting (even with superficial modifications) without citation is considered plagiarism, and will be treated as such.
- **Don't** forget that you will still need to demonstrate proficiency on all your exams to pass the course!



#### Late Policy, Extensions, and Makeup

##### Late Deduction
For each day that a homework assignment is late beyond the due date (or the adjusted date according to your accommodations), I assess a $$3^d\%$$ deduction, where $$d$$ is the number of days late including weekends. 

##### Deadline Extensions
At my discretion, extensions on assignments may only be given depending on circumstances like pacing, clarification, etc. Extensions are not generally granted on a *personal* basis, except if the student can provide documentation for unique circumstances (e.g., injury/hospitalization, bereavement, etc.), or when the student is entitled to certain accommodations. As a general rule of thumb, just come talk to me first.

##### Exam Policies
Sample problem sets and a checklist of expected topics are provided in a study guide. Unless a student has accommodations, exams are always in written format. Students are *allowed* to bring a full page of notes (front + back) to the exam, which must be turned in along with the exam.

- Exam dates: I have never had to move an exam from its scheduled date, but if I did, I would never move them earlier, only later.

- Final Exam: You must show up on the scheduled set day of the final exam. These dates are set by the university and cannot be rescheduled. Please do not ask for exceptions.

- Makeup: I expect you to be present on the day of exams. I do not offer makeups unless you can _document_ an extenuating circumstance. The following do not count as extenuating circumstances: experiencing a cold, overslept, family visiting, traveling, etc. If a makeup exam is granted, you will receive a different version than everyone else.

- Student Accommodations: It is *your* responsibility to inform me if you will be taking exams at the accommodations office well-ahead of time, so that I have time to provide exam copies to their office.

- The following items are prohibited for use on the day of exams: Phones (even with WIFI disabled), headphones, and other mobile devices.
