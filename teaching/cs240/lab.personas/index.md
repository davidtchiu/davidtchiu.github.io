## CS 240 - Software Engineering

### Personas and Scenarios

By this time, you should have a rough idea of what your term software project will be, and it's useful to think about who might be using your product, and in what ways. In this exercise you will be working with your team to write personas and scenarios for your software.

#### Student Outcomes

- To practice the agile design process

#### Part 1 - Personas

- Start by creating a new Github project called `design-docs` and clone it down to your machines.

- Think about all the various **types of users** who might use your software, and write up a persona for each type (a paragraph or two should suffice for each persona). Persona could be imagined, or they might be representative of potential users that you surveyed. Whichever the case, personas should be based on an understanding of the potential product users, their jobs, their background and their aspirations.

- Here are all the elements you should include for each persona:

  - Personal information about the user (personalization)
  - Details of the individual's job (job-related)
  - Details of their interest in the product (relevance)
  - Details of their education and experience (education)

- Here is an example of a persona we saw in lecture for the iLearn system:

  ```
  Elena, a school IT technician

  Elena, age 28, is a senior IT technician in a large secondary school (high school) in Glasgow with over 2000 students. Originally from Poland, she has a diploma in electronics from Potsdam University. She moved to Scotland in 2011 after being unemployed for a year after graduation. She has a Scottish partner, no children, and hopes to develop her career in Scotland. She was originally appointed as a junior technician but was promoted, in 2014,  to a senior post responsible for all the school computers.

  Although not involved directly in teaching, Elena is often called on to help in computer science classes. She is a competent Python programmer and is a ‘power user’ of digital technologies. She has a long-term career goal of becoming a technical expert in digital learning technologies and being involved in their development. She wants to become an expert in the iLearn system and sees it as an experimental platform for supporting new uses for digital learning.
