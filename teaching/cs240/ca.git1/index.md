## Git Basics

In this exercise you will be trying out basic git operations, including staging, committing, and undoing.

## Student Outcomes

- Starting a git project from scratch
- Staging and committing changes
- Undoing changes

## Part 1 - Initializing and Committing

- From your file system, create a new directory called `zoo/`. This directory will store an inventory of animals in different sections of our zoo.

- Now open up that directory from VS Code, and open up the Terminal to that project. (Ask for help if you don't remember how to open the integrated terminal). From the terminal, go ahead and initialize git in the zoo directory. Recall that the command-line syntax to initialize git is:

```
git init
```

Make sure your current working directory must be in `zoo/` before issuing this command.
