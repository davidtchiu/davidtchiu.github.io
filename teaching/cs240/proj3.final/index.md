## CS 240 - Software Engineering

### Project 3: Wrap up and Final Presentation

#### Student Outcomes

- To communicate orally through a project demonstration.
- To reflect on your own contributions and evaluate others.

#### Final Demo

The end is near, and now it's time to show off what you'd been working on to all of us. Be prepared by the day of the final to give a 15-20 minute demo presentation to the class on your project, allowing a few minutes for question and answer. The demo should showcase the core functionalities of your software prototype, and every team member must have equal participation in the demo (you will be graded on balance). The demo should be organized, which means you should prepare a "script," with fluid transitions from one presenter to another. It is recommended that you do a couple practice-runs to iron out all the wrinkles before the class demo. The demo does count for a significant portion of your final grade.

<!-- Peer Evaluation: Members of the class will each submit an anonymous evaluation on your team's project and demo (out of 10 points). You will be assigned the average of their evaluations. As you evaluate others team, try to be objective about the content and quality of their implementation, and not about how enthusiastic you are about project idea.

Peer Eval Form
Internal Evaluation: Members of your team will each submit an anonymous evaluation of the other team members to me. In this evaluation, you should be honest about the work balance and dynamics of yourself and other members.

Internal Eval Form
Instructor's Evaluation: Finally, you will receive an evaluation from me about my assessment on the quality of your work.

#### Submissions

At the end of the each week (sprint), the project manager must submit to me the following on canvas:

1. Their scrum log with scores for each team member, and a quick justification for the score.
2. A link to your github project page, which is why it's important that everyone commits and pushes.
3. A link to your team's Trello board.

#### Grading

```
This assignment will be graded out of 100 points:
[10pt] Your database is normalized to BCNF, and populated using dummy or real data.
[45pt] The use-cases you outlined in the project planning phase are implemented properly and resist SQL injection.
[10pt] The in-class demo/presentation is well-prepared, fluid, and organized.
[10pt] Peer evaluation. All other teams will evaluate the quality of your project.
[25pt] Internal/self evaluation. Each of your teammates will evaluate your contributions to the overall project.

Misc.
[-5pt] Failure to turn in a peer evaluation. (Both demo days)
[-5pt] Failure to turn in an internal evaluation. (Final Exam)
