Overview:

Artificial Intelligence is embedded in many of the tools and services we use every day, often in ways that are not obvious. This assignment invites you to observe and reflect on your personal interactions with AI over the course of one week. The goal is to build greater awareness of how AI is already shaping everyday life, even in subtle or hidden ways.



Assignment Instructions:

From Monday to Sunday, keep a daily journal of any time you think you might be interacting with AI. These may include:

Using voice assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, Xiao Ai)

Watching videos recommended to you by YouTube or LINE TV

Receiving product suggestions on Shopee, PChome, or other shopping platforms

Using AI-powered tools like translation apps, camera filters, or predictive typing

AI chatbots, when making travel bookings or customer service inquiries

Smart features in MRT ticketing machines or banking apps

Any AI features used in class, like automated feedback, writing suggestions, or learning apps

If you’re not sure whether something uses AI, that’s okay. Guess based on what you know, and mark your uncertainty in the entry. Part of this assignment is learning to spot AI, even when it’s not obvious.



For each interaction, briefly include:

Date and time

What you did

Where or what service/tool you used

What role AI played (if known or guessed)

Was the experience helpful, frustrating, unnoticed, or surprising?

Are you sure it was AI? If not, what made you wonder?

Final Reflection (200–300 words):
At the end of the week, write a short reflection responding to:

How often did you interact with AI, based on your journal?

Were there moments you were unsure whether AI was involved?

Did you notice any patterns in how AI supported or influenced your daily routines?

Did anything surprise or concern you?

Has this changed your awareness or perspective on AI?

What to Expect Next:
We’ll discuss your experiences in class next week. Please bring a few examples you’d be comfortable sharing. We’ll also revisit this journal later in the semester as we explore AI more fully, so keep your file for future reference.
