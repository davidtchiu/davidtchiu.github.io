Homework: Teach a Computer with Teachable Machine

Goal:
In this assignment, you will teach a computer how to recognize different things, like sounds, pictures, or poses, using a tool called Google Teachable Machine. You do not need any coding experience.

What You’ll Do:

Visit the Website:
Go to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com

Choose One of These Project Types:

Image Project: Use your webcam to teach it to recognize different objects or hand signs

Audio Project: Use your microphone to teach it to recognize different sounds (like clapping, snapping, or silence)

Pose Project: Use your webcam to teach it to recognize different body positions (like standing, sitting, or raising one hand)

Create 3 Categories:
For example, if you do an image project, you might teach the machine:

Thumbs up

Thumbs down

Peace sign

Or for audio:

Clap

Snap

A laugh

You decide! Be creative and have fun.

Train the Machine:

Add at least 20 examples for each category

Follow the instructions on the screen to “record” each one using your webcam or microphone

Then click the "Train Model" button

Test It Out:
Try using the model to see if it can guess what you’re showing or doing. Try to “trick” it and see how it reacts.

Turn In the Following:

A screenshot of your trained model

A screenshot of it trying to guess your input

A short paragraph (4–6 sentences) answering these questions:

What did you try to teach it?

Was it easy or hard?

Was the machine good at guessing?

What surprised you?

How to Submit:
Upload a PDF of your screenshots and paragraph to our class platform before the deadline.
