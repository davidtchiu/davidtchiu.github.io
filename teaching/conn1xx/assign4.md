Homework Assignment: Deep Dive into Two AI Systems
Format: Submit as a single PDF document via ILearn

Length: Approximately 2–3 pages total (typed, double-spaced, standard font)

Overview
Last week, you tracked the different ways you interacted with AI in your daily life. This week, you will choose two of the AI systems or tools from your journal and explore them more deeply. Your goal is to better understand how each one works and reflect on how it affects your life and society more broadly.

Instructions
For each of the two AI systems/tools, write a section that addresses the following:

1. Description of the AI system
What is it (name and type)?

Where and how did you use it?

What problem is it designed to solve?

2. What kind of AI is it?
Identify the main AI technique it uses (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, neural networks, GPT, combinations, etc.).

If you’re not sure, do a bit of research and take your best guess, explaining your reasoning.

3. How does it work (at a high level)?
Explain the logic behind it in plain language.

Include what kind of data it likely uses to operate and what it might be learning from.

Try to find where the training data came from, if you aren't able to find it give you best guess.
If you can, relate it to a method we've covered in class (e.g., decision trees, clustering, GPT).
4. Benefits and concerns
What are the benefits of this AI system?

What are some ethical, social, or personal concerns that might arise from its use?

5. Personal reflection
Has learning more about this AI changed how you feel about using it?

Would you continue to use it in the same way? Why or why not?

6. Citations
Make sure to include sources for the facts you included (sources cannot be an LLM)


Formatting Requirements
