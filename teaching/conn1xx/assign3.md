## Make AI hallucinate

Objective
Learn what LLM (Large Language Model) hallucinations are by observing one directly, verifying facts, and reflecting on how this affects the use of AI in everyday life.

Part 1: Ask 3 Factual Questions (2 points)
Pick three factual questions related to topics you already know. Pose these questions to  ChatGPT (or a similar LLM).

Record your three questions.

Paste the full responses you received.

Underline or highlight anything that seemed strange, surprising, or wrong.

Part 2: Verify the Answers (2 points)
Do some quick fact-checking using reliable NON-AI sources like source articles, news articles, or government sites.

List any errors, inaccuracies, or hallucinated facts.

Mention the sources you used to confirm or correct the information.

Part 3: Trick the AI On Purpose (2 points)
Ask the AI a vague, obscure, or made-up question (example: “What are the top universities in the city of Atlantis?”).

Record the question and full AI response.

Note whether the AI made something up or admitted uncertainty.

Part 4: Reflection (4 short answers, 1 point each)
Answer the following reflection prompts in 4–6 sentences each:

What is an LLM hallucination, in your own words?

Why do LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations instead of saying “I don’t know”?

What are the potential dangers of hallucinations in real-world settings (like school, business, medicine, or government)?

How can you responsibly use AI tools while avoiding over-relying on incorrect information?
