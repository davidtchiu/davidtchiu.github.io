#### Course Description
This course is a continuation of the topics introduced in CSCI 161. It provides an introduction to the study of fundamental data structures and their associated algorithms. Students will learn about lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, abstract data types, and object-oriented programming using Java, and learn how to choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for particular problems. 

#### Prerequisites
A grade of C- or higher in the following course is required, or with permission from the instructor:
- CSCI 161: Introduction to Computer Science
Students with transfer credit for CSCI 261 may not take this course.

#### Required Textbook
[Koffman and Wolfgang. Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java. 3rd edition or higher.](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Abstraction-Design-Using/dp/1119703611)


#### Course Topics
- Object inheritance and polymorphism
- Basic principles of complexity analysis and the "Big-O" notation
- Data structures and associated operations (including lists, queues, stack, trees, and maps)
- Recursion, recursive data structures
- Sorting algorithms


#### Student Learning Outcomes
After the successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
- Write programs that use key abstract data types provided in the language (e.g., arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and associative data types like sets, dictionaries/maps).
- Select the appropriate data structure for a given problem.
- Explain how the performance of a program may change when using different data structures or
operations.
- Explain the concept of recursion and identify when and how to use it effectively.
- Develop recursive methods.
- Analyze an algorithm, including recursive algorithms, using "Big-O" notation.
- Develop programs that can handle runtime errors.


#### Grades
Your overall grade is broken down as as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 5% |
| Lab Assignments | 10% |
| Homework Assignments | 30% |
| Midterm I | 15% |
| Midterm II | 18% |
| Final Exam (comprehensive) | 22% |

##### Lab Assignments
Labs provide a low stakes, hands-on, and collaborative way to learn the materials. As such, they only represent 10% of your final grade. You may choose to work alone, or with whomever you like during lab. **However, you must submit your own work.**

For full credit, you must attend weekly labs and submit your lab assignments by the next day. Each lab is worth 2 points, with a simple grading policy:
- On-time attendance + completion (due next day): 2 points
- Late attendance or minimal effort: 1 point
- No-show or no submission: 0 points

Because labs are always due the next day and are graded on attendance and effort, there is no extension for labs. Missing lab is unacceptable. Unless you have excused absences (e.g., athletics, bereavement, medical, etc.), missing over half the lab sessions, will result in an automatic withdrawal or an F for the course.

##### Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are assigned every 1.5 - 2 weeks. Unless otherwise noted, you are to work on homework assignments alone. You are welcome to brainstorm with others (including tutors) for ideas, but any code you submit should be yours.

**Do not copy code you find on the web and/or ChatGPT.** This is considered plagiarism. Please see the "Academic Integrity" section below.
