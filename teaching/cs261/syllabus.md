## CS 261 Syllabus


#### Course Description
This course is a continuation of the topics introduced in CSCI 161. It provides an introduction to the study of fundamental data structures and their associated algorithms. Students will learn about lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, abstract data types, and object-oriented programming using Java, and learn how to choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for particular problems. 

#### Prerequisites
A grade of C- or higher in the following course is required, or with permission from the instructor:
- CSCI 161: Introduction to Computer Science
Students with transfer credit for CSCI 261 may not take this course.

#### Required Textbook
[Koffman and Wolfgang. Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java. 3rd edition or higher.](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Abstraction-Design-Using/dp/1119703611/)


#### Course Topics
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Exception handling
- Basic principles of complexity analysis and the "Big-O" notation
- Data structures and associated operations (including lists, queues, stack, trees, and maps)
- Recursion and recursive data structures
- Sorting algorithms


#### Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Design and implement reasonably sized Java programs from scratch, maximizing code reuse.
- Gracefully handle error-reporting in Java programs.
- Analyze an algorithm using "Big-O" notation.
- Make informed decisions on choosing an appropriate data structure for a given task by understanding their tradeoffs and considering their performance in the common case.

#### Grades
Your overall grade is broken down as as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 3% |
| Lab Assignments | 10% |
| Homework Assignments | 35% |
| Midterm I | 15% |
| Midterm II | 17% |
| Final Exam | 20% |

These are my cutoffs for assigning your final letter grades. Please note that decimals are ignored (e.g., 89.99% = B+).

| Final Average  | Letter Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 100% - 95% | A |
| 94% - 90% | A- |
| 89% - 87% | B+ |
| 86% - 83% | B |
| 82% - 80% | B- |
| 79% - 77% | C+ |
| 76% - 73% | C |
| 72% - 70% | C- |
| 69% - 67% | D+ |
| 66% - 63% | D |
| 62% - 60% | D- |
| 59% and below | F |

##### Lab Assignments
Labs provide a low stakes, hands-on, and collaborative way to learn the materials. As such, they only represent 10% of your final grade. You may choose to work alone, or with whomever you like during lab. **However, you must submit your own work.**

For full credit, you must attend weekly labs and submit your lab assignments by the next day. Each lab is worth 2 points, with a simple grading policy:
- On-time attendance + completion (due next day): 2 points
- Late attendance or minimal effort: 1 point
- No-show or no submission: 0 points

Because labs are always due the next day and are graded on attendance and effort, there is no extension for labs.

##### Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are assigned every 1.5 - 2 weeks. Unless otherwise noted, you are to work on homework assignments alone. You are welcome to brainstorm with others (including tutors) for ideas, but any code you submit should be yours.

**Do not copy code you find on the web and/or ChatGPT.** This is considered plagiarism. Please see the "Academic Integrity" section below.

##### Homework Late Penalty and Extensions
For each day that an assignment is late (including weekends), a $$3^d\%$$ deduction, where $$d$$ is the number of days late, will be assessed. Because ample amounts of time are provided to complete each assignment (usually around 1-2 weeks) no extensions be will given for homework assignments, unless you are experiencing unique circumstances or for accommodations.

##### Exams
There will be two midterms and a final exam. They will cover topics discussed in the lectures, readings from the assigned textbook, and assignments. The exams are cumulative. Study guides are provided and selected problems are reviewed on the lecture preceding the day of the exam. You are allowed a page of notes (front and back) on all exams. 

- Make-up: I expect you to be present on the day of exams. I do not offer make-up exams unless you can demonstrate documented extenuating circumstances. (These do not count as extenuating circumstances: experiencing a cold, overslept, family visiting, etc.)

- Accommodations: It is *your* responsibility to inform me if you will be taking it at SAA well-ahead of time, so that I have time to get the exams over to their office.

- The following items are prohibited on the day of exams: Graphing calculators, phones, headphones, and other mobile devices.


##### Attendance and Participation
Regular attendance and participation are required. Attendance, to be graded out of 10 points, applies towards your final grade. I deduct **2 points** for each unexcused absence, **1 point** for being late, and **1 point** for engaging in activities that can disrupt others: scrolling through your phone, texting, playing games on your laptop, etc.


#### Course Policies

##### No Laptops, No Phones
Laptop computers and other handheld devices are a common distraction during lectures. Except on lab days and for those who can provide documentation of need from the office of SAA, please don't bring your laptops to lectures. Please turn your phones off, or at least put your phones on silent during lecture.

##### Academic Integrity
You should uphold the school's *Student Integrity Code*. Any suspected cheating (plagiarizing code, copying homework solutions, etc.) will be reported to the Registrar, which may result in possible suspension/expulsion and loss of financial aid. 

##### Student Accessibility and Accommodation (SAA)
If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact Peggy Perno, Director of the Office of Accessibility and Accommodation, 105 Howarth, 253.879.3395. She will determine with you what accommodations are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential.

##### Classroom Emergency Response Guidance
Please review university emergency preparedness and response procedures posted at [https://www.pugetsound.edu/emergency](https://www.pugetsound.edu/emergency). There is a link on the university home page. Familiarize yourself with hall exit doors and the designated gathering area for your class and laboratory buildings.
 
If building evacuation becomes necessary (e.g., earthquake), meet your instructor at the designated gathering area so she/he can account for your presence. Then wait for further instructions. Do not return to the building or classroom until advised by a university emergency response representative.
 
If confronted by an act of violence, be prepared to make quick decisions to protect your safety. Flee the area by running away from the source of danger if you can safely do so. If this is not possible, shelter in place by securing classroom or lab doors and windows, closing blinds, and turning off room lights. Lie on the floor out of sight and away from windows and doors. Place cell phones or pagers on vibrate so that you can receive messages quietly. Wait for further instructions.

##### Student Bereavement Policy
The University of Puget Sound recognizes that a time of bereavement can be difficult for a student. Therefore,  the university provides a Student Bereavement Policy for students facing the loss of a family member. Students are normally eligible for, and faculty members are expected to grant, three consecutive weekdays of excused absences, without penalty, for the death of a family member, including parent, grandparent, sibling, or persons living in the same household. Should the student feel that additional days are necessary, the student must request additional bereavement leave from the Dean of Students or the Dean's designee. In the event of the death of another family member or friend not explicitly included within this policy, a bereaved student may petition for grief absence through the Dean of Studentsâ€™ office for approval.

##### Student Religious Accommodation
The university provides reasonable religious accommodations for academic courses and programs, and the university policy is found [here](https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/human-resources/policies/campus-policies/student-religious-accommodations-in-academic-courses-or-programs}{https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/human-resources/policies/campus-policies/student-religious-accommodations-in-academic-courses-or-programs).
