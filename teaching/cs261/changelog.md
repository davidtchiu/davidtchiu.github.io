# TODO
- Write a new interfaces lab (lab 4 currently too easy/short)
- Exam 1 implementation worth too much
- Need to reformat all assignments to .md

# Change Log
- Hwk 6 now Evil Hangman with recursion requirements
- Move expression tree back into Lab 9 (Linked structures, recursion)
- Removed pooled testing
