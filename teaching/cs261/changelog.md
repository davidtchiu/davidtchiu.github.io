# TODO
- Move pooled testing to Hwk 3 or 4?
- Write a recursion homework (hwk 6 - heaps/priority queues)
- Write a new interfaces lab (lab 4 currently too easy/short)
- Exam 1 implementation worth too much


# Change Log
- Move expression tree back into Lab 9 (Linked structures, recursion)
- Scatter sorting algos throughout the course. Do a couple during big-O; do a couple more during recursion
