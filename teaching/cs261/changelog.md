# Notes to Future Self
- Don't introduce IntelliJ/Eclipse until after inheritance lectures/labs

# TODO
- Need more code along labs! Maybe start all labs as code alongs.
- Hwk 2: TTT - Insist that they keep a list of known open coordinates
    - In Player? In RandomPlayer?
    - What about Cooords?
- Replace RG1 and RG1 sol (no more exceptions)
- Students say they prefer Monday due dates???
- Get assignment starter code on github
