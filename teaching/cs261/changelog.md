# TODO
- Don't introduce IntelliJ/Eclipse until after inheritance lectures/labs
- Lec 1b: polymorphism -- Can I use pipe-cleaners somehow?
- Exam 1 implementation worth too much
- Get assignment starter code on github
- Might consider adding Exceptions into Lab 4: Interfaces, and go with a perf lab for Lab 5?
- Big-O: Don't spend anymore time talking about caching, and all that. Just move on to counting steps.
- Hwk 3: Need to be more instructive on free-form Hwk assignments. Maybe wean them in over time.
- Consider changing Lab 6 to LinkedList lab (problem is scheduling, but do I really need to implement MyArrayList?)
- Hwk 3-4: Get rid of the punctuation Exception stuff. Simply keep the 2-scoring.
- Hwk 6 RCV: tell them to use a priority queue.
- Hwk 8: EHM for maps

# Change Log
- Rewrote interface lab (Lab 4) to consider checksums (Fall 22)
- Hwk 6 now Evil Hangman with recursion requirements (Fall 22)
- Move expression tree back into Lab 9 - Linked structures, recursion (Fall 22)
- Removed pooled testing (Fall 22)
- Scatter sorting algos throughout the course. Do a couple during big-O; do a couple more during recursion (Fall 22)
