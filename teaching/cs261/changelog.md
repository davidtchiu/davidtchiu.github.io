# TODO
- Don't introduce IntelliJ/Eclipse until after inheritance lectures/labs
- Lec 1b: polymorphism -- Can I use pipe-cleaners somehow?
- Exam 1 implementation worth too much
- Get assignment starter code on github
- Might consider adding Exceptions into Lab 4: Interfaces, and go with a perf lab for Lab 5?
- Big-O: Don't spend anymore time talking about caching, and all that. Just move on to counting steps.
