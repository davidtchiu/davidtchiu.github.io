# TODO
- Move pooled testing to Hwk 3 or 4?
- Add heaps and heapsort as Hwk 6. (Recursion)
- Give driver/test code on last exam
- Interface lab too easy/short
- Swap hwk 3 and 4? (4 seems too redundant, or may actually be easier)
- Exam 1 implementation worth too much
- Hwk 4 (autocomplete): give them that GUI? Does it give too much solution away?


# Change Log
- Scatter sorting algos throughout the course. Do a couple during big-O; do a couple more during recursion
