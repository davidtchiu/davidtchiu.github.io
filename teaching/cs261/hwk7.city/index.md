</center>

Your job in this assignment is to build a **CityTracker** that stores information about cities and their populations. Specifically, you'll need to:

- Insert cities into a data structure
- Quickly determine the city with **median population**
- Count how many cities fall **below a certain population**
- Retrieve all cities in a **population range**

These are the perfect use case for a binary search tree, because it can support some of these operations more efficiently than lists. We'll represent cities using a new `City` class (given and shown below), and store these objects in a **Binary Search Tree**, ordered by population.

## Student Outcomes
By completing this assignment, you should be able to:
- Design and implement recursive algorithms to perform rank-based queries (get, getRank, rangeOf)
- Recognize when to extend the BST to support new functionality (e.g., realizing CityTracker needs more from the base version of the BST)
- Demonstrate good object-oriented design practices, including encapsulation and method decomposition


#### Part 1: BinarySearchTree Enhancements
Start by adding the following modifications to our `BinarySearchTree` class. 

**Size Caching:** One problem that we have not yet discussed is the efficiency of the `size()` and `sizeHelper()` methods, used to recursively determine the number of nodes in a (sub)tree. Unfortunately, our current implementation runs in $$O(n)$$ time, where $$n$$ is the number of nodes in the subtree, because we need to recursively traverse the whole tree! This presents a problem when `sizeHelper()` is called repeatedly. 

    But because the size of a (sub)tree is known as we insert and remove elements, it's a candidate for caching, so with a bit elbow grease, we can make it run in $$O(1)$$! Specifically, we want to modify our BST so that it has the following node structure:

    <center>
    <IMG SRC="figures/sizecaching_tree.png" width = "250" style="border: 10px solid #d6d6d6" />
    </center>

    Recall that every node in a BST serves as the root of its own subtree, so we want each node stores its corresponding subtree's size. Start by adding a `size` instance variable to the `Node<E>` inner class that is defined inside the `BinaryTree<E>` superclass. In the `Node` constructor, simply set `size` to 1.

    - Back in `BinarySearchTree`, modify the `sizeHelper()` method so that it simply returns the new size field of the `localRoot` node. 
    
    - Now modify `add()` so that it takes no action if the item is already in the tree. Then, modify `addHelper()` so that it increments the size. Similarly, modify `remove()` so that it takes no action if the target is not in the tree. Then, modify `removeHelper()` so that it decrements the size.

    - Test this method to ensure it's working before moving on. Make sure that the size is correct for not only the root node, but for *all* nodes.


Next, let's add a few more BST methods that'll make our lives easier down the road. As with most of our other BST methods, you should write these methods recursively by having a private helper method do all the recursive traversal. Recall that the recursive helper method usually has this look: `private helperMethod(Node<E> localRoot, ...)`, where `localRoot` is the root of the current (sub)tree to be explored.

1. Implement the `public E get(int index)` method that returns the element whose in-order position is at the given `index`. For example, when `index = 0` it returns the smallest element in the tree. When `index = 1` it returns the second smallest element, and so on. If `index` is invalid (less than zero or greater than `size()-1`), then this method simply returns `null`.

    - Your recursive helper method should have this signature:
        ```java
        private E getHelper(Node<E> localRoot, int index)
        ```

    - Recursive Strategy: 
        ```txt
        Return null if the local root is null
        Otherwise, 
            Compute size of left subtree  // You have sizeHelper() for that!
            if index == sizeOfLeftSubtree,
                return current root's data (Base case #2)
            if index < sizeOfLeftSubtree,
                // The element is in the left subtree
                Recurse left
            if index > sizeOfLeftSubtree,
                // The element is in the right subtree.
                Recurse right with (index - sizeOfLeftSubtree - 1)
        ```

    - Here's an example usage:

        ```java
        BinarySearchTree<Integer> tree = new BinarySearchTree<>();
        tree.add(40);
        tree.add(20);
        tree.add(60);
        tree.add(10);
        tree.add(30);
        tree.add(50);
        tree.add(70);
        System.out.println(tree.get(0));   // 10
        System.out.println(tree.get(3));   // 40
        System.out.println(tree.get(6));   // 70
        System.out.println(tree.get(7));   // null
        ```

3. Implement another method `public int getRank(E target)` method that returns the number of elements in the BST that are _strictly smaller_ than the `target`.

    - This method should simply pass the current root node and the `target` to the helper method.

    - Your recursive helper method should have this signature:
        ```java
        private int getRankHelper(Node<E> localRoot, E target)
        ```

    - Recursive Strategy:
        ```txt
        Return 0 if the current root is null
        if target == current root, 
            // It's bigger than all nodes in the left subtree
            // So its rank must be the size of the left subtree
            return the size of the left subtree
        if target < current root,
            // target is in the left subtree
            recurse down the left subtree to find target's rank
            return that rank
        if target > current root,
            // target's rank is more than all nodes in the left subtree
            // and the current root.
            recurse down the right subtree to find its rank
            add 1 + sizeOfLeftSubtree + the rank returned from the recursion
            return this sum
        ```

    - Here's an example usage, assuming the same elements added as the code snippet given above: 
        ```java
        System.out.println(tree.getRank(25));  // 2 (10, 20 are less than 25)
        System.out.println(tree.getRank(40));  // 3 (10, 20, 30 are less than 40)
        System.out.println(tree.getRank(5));   // 0
        ```

4. Finally, write the `public List<E> rangeOf(E begin, E end)` method that returns a list of all elements in the BST that fall within the specified range inclusive of the endpoints. The elements are returned in sorted (in-order) order. If no elements fall within the given range, return an empty list.

    - This method should construct an `ArrayList<E>` and pass it to the helper method, defined below. The helper method will populate this list, and then you can return it.

    - Your recursive helper method should have this signature:
        ```java
        private void rangeOfHelper(Node<E> localRoot, E begin, E end, List<E> list)
        ```

    - Strategy:
        ```txt
        if current root == null, do nothing.

        if begin < current root,
            // starting point is smaller than root, so
            // there might be more elements down the left
            recurse down left subtree
        if begin <= current root <= end,
            // the root is within the specified range! Add to list.
            add current root's data to the list
        if begin > current root,
            // end point is larger than root, so
            // there might be more elements down the right
            recurse down right subtree
        ```    

    - Here's an example usage, assuming the same elements added as the code snippet given above: 
        ```java
        System.out.println(tree.rangeOf(15, 55));  // [20, 30, 40, 50]
        System.out.println(tree.rangeOf(100, 200));  // []
        ```




#### Part 2: City and CityTracker
Now we can work on tracking various cities and answering queries!

- Note that a `City` class has been provided to you, and you do not need to make any changes to it.
    - It provides getters for a city's name and population. Curiously, it provides a default constructor that creates a `null` city, with a population. You'll use this later for searches.

    - Now check out the `compareTo()` method and notice that cities are compared by their populations, and not by their names. So, this defines the way that a BST would internally order your cities!

- Open `CityTracker`. It manages a set of cities inside a binary search tree. Write the following methods for `CityTracker`. All the methods below should be really easy to write because we've already done the hard work!

    1. `public void addCity(String name, int population)`: This method needs to construct a new City object to encapsulate the the given arguments, and add it to the BST. 

        ```java
        CityTracker tracker = new CityTracker();

        tracker.addCity("Seattle", 737015);
        tracker.addCity("Olympia", 55919);
        tracker.addCity("Spokane", 228989);
        tracker.addCity("Tacoma", 219346);
        tracker.addCity("Bellevue", 151854);
        tracker.addCity("Redmond", 76995);
        tracker.addCity("Bellingham", 92489);

        // notice that cities are listed in order of population
        tracker.listCities();   // [Olympia (55919), Redmond (76995), Bellingham (92489), Bellevue (151854),
                                //    Tacoma (219346), Spokane (228989), Seattle (737015)]
        ```

    2. `public City medianCity()`: This method returns city with the median population. Let's say there are 5 cities stored in the tree, ordered by population. The median city is the one that would appear third in sorted order. In case of an even number of cities, return the smaller one. This method is easy to write using the new `get()` method we added previously.

        ```java
        System.out.println(tracker.medianCity()); 
        // Bellevue (151854)
        ```

    3. `public int numCitiesBelow(int population)`: This method returns the number of cities with a population strictly less than the given population. It seems like you should be using `getRank()` here, but inputs a City object. Ah -- use the 1-argument City constructor to create a "dummy" city with this population to input into `getRank()`!

        ```java
        System.out.println(tracker.numCitiesBelow(200000); 
        // 4  <--- That is: Olympia, Redmond, Bellingham, Bellevue!
        ```

    4. `public List<City> citiesInRange(int lower, int upper)`: This method returns a list of cities with a population that's between `lower` and `upper`, inclusive.

        ```java
        System.out.println(tracker.citiesInRange(80000, 230000));
        // [Bellingham (92489), Bellevue (151854), Tacoma (219346), Spokane (228989)]
        ```

#### Program Defensively

You can't control how another user or program chooses to use your methods. For each method, think critically about all the things that could go wrong and cause an unintended result (e.g., a runtime error, infinite loop/recursion, etc.). Chances are, I'll be trying all kinds of inputs (negative values, zeroes, nulls, empty-strings, etc.) when I grade your program. The mark of a good programmer is one that can anticipate such scenarios ahead of time and ensure that their program handles all sorts of errors gracefully.

#### Commenting

Each and every method should have a "javadoc-style" comment above it (the ones that use `/* ... */`). For full credit, you should use the @param and @return tags as appropriate in these method comments. Each instance variable (field) should have a brief comment as well. Don't forget the main comment at the top of the class either - I'm looking for more than just a sentence or two.
