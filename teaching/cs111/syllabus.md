## CS 111 - Intermediate and Object-Oriented Programming - Syllabus


#### Course Description
This course builds upon introductory programming fundamentals, unifying prior programming preparation within Java and its object-oriented programming (OOP) framework. Emphasis is placed on developing fluency in Java and strengthening the use of abstraction, modularity, and polymorphism in software design. This course also introduces topics such as recursion and elementary complexity analysis as foundational tools for problem solving and reasoning about algorithmic efficiency. This course has a weekly laboratory.

#### Prerequisites
One of CS 110, ART 288, or DATA 160, with a grade of C- or higher.

#### Required Textbook
Notes, code, and other related course materials provided by the instructor.


#### Course Topics

- Object-oriented programming
- 2D Arrays
- Elementary complexity analysis (e.g., searching, sorting)
- Recursion
- File handling
- Object inheritance, constructor chaining, and polymorphism
- Abstract classes, interfaces, and implementations
- Exception handling



#### Student Learning Outcomes
After the successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Apply object-oriented programming principles
- Construct and use class hierarchies
- Develop modular programs using interfaces and abstraction
- Use recursion to solve computational problems
- Analyze algorithmic efficiency at an elementary level
- Manipulate arrays and 2D arrays
- Implement file handling for data-driven programs
- Develop programs that can handle runtime errors
- Work effectively in a structured lab setting


#### Grades
Your overall grade is broken down as as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 5% |
| Lab Assignments | 10% |
| Homework Assignments | 30% |
| Midterm I | 15% |
| Midterm II | 18% |
| Final Exam (comprehensive) | 22% |

##### Lab Assignments
Labs provide a low stakes, hands-on, and collaborative way to learn the materials. As such, they only represent 10% of your final grade. You may choose to work alone, or with whomever you like during lab. **However, you must submit your own work.**

For full credit, you must attend weekly labs and submit your lab assignments by the next day. Each lab is worth 2 points, with a simple grading policy:
- On-time attendance + completion (due next day): 2 points
- Late attendance or minimal effort: 1 point
- No-show or no submission: 0 points

Because labs are always due the next day and are graded on attendance and effort, there is no extension for labs. Missing lab is unacceptable. Unless you have excused absences (e.g., athletics, bereavement, medical, etc.), missing over half the lab sessions, will result in an automatic withdrawal or an F for the course.

##### Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are assigned every 1.5 - 2 weeks. Unless otherwise noted, you are to work on homework assignments alone. You are welcome to brainstorm with others (including tutors) for ideas, but any code you submit should be yours.
