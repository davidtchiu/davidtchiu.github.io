## CS 498 - Capstone Planning Seminar - Syllabus


#### Course Description
This 0-unit pass/fail course provides structure for students as they prepare for their senior capstone in computer science. Students identify a feasible project topic, survey relevant literature and technologies, and develop a coherent project plan that positions them to begin substantive work at the start of the following semester. Emphasis is placed on team definition (if applicable), project scoping, design, data acquisition, and early prototyping. By the end of the course, students will have a well-defined problem statement, an initial technical design, a shared code repository, a communication plan, and a realistic timeline for completing their project. Students are also required to attend talks at the Math/CS Seminar. This course is taken the semester before the capstone and focuses on preparation rather than implementation.

#### Prerequisites
Senior class standing, or permission of instructor.

<!-- #### Student Learning Outcomes
Students taking this course will:
-  -->

#### 1. Project Topic + Problem Statement (Weeks 1-3)
A short document that:
- Identifies group members, if applicable
- States the core problem and motivation  
- Explains who benefits and why it matters: develop personas
- Describes constraints and assumptions  
- Includes at least three alternative project directions before narrowing down  

#### 2. Background + Related Work (Weeks 3-5)
A concise write-up or annotated bibliography that demonstrates the students:
- Has read existing work that has been done in the field
- Has selected the technologies, frameworks, or data sets they intend to use  
- Understand what existing tools can and can't be used
- Identify required background they still need to learn
- An ethics/risk assessment (e.g., data privacy, misuse, accessibility)  

#### 3. Feasibility Analysis (Weeks 6-7)
A short technical memo identifying:
- Risks and unknowns
- Scope boundaries  
- A fallback/minimal-viable version of the project  

#### 4. High-Level Design Document (Weeks 8-12)
This should include:
- System architecture diagram  
- Key modules, data structures, or models  
- External dependencies and APIs
- Preliminary UI sketches if relevant  
- Story development
- A description of the main technical challenges  


#### 5. Final Capstone Plan and Timeline (Week 13-15)
A formal document with all of the above, plus:
- Milestones and 2–3 week sprint goals  
- Dependencies  
- Time estimates  
- Plans for testing or experimental evaluation
- Contingency plans  
- Reach goals

#### 6. Capstone Proposal Defense (Finals Week)
A presentation delivered to faculty and peers that covers:
- Motivation  
- Background  
- Design  
- Early results or prototype, if applicable
- Timeline and feasibility  


<!-- #### 5. Prototype or Proof-of-Concept Artifact
Something small but non-trivial, such as:
- A minimal pipeline that loads one dataset  
- A basic CRUD skeleton for a web app  
- A trained baseline model  
- A hardware demo that exercises sensors/actuators  
- A single algorithm implemented in isolation   -->
