| 1    | Our first algorithm                              | What is CS, anyway?                                 | Lab 1 | Objects vs. Classes; the `Circle` class |
| 2    | Objects vs. Classes; the Circle class            | Variables and data types, methods, and constructors | Lab 2 | Saving algorithms; Method calls         |
| 3    | Writing classes: `TicketMachine`. Printing       | Conditionals                                        | Lab 3 | `Random`, more conditionals, `return`   |
