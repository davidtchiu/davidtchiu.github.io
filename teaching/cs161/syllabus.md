## CS 161 - Introduction to Computer Science - Syllabus


#### Course Description
This course is an introduction to computer science and programming. The programming language Java is used to illustrate concepts in computer science. The course emphasizes the use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the development of good programming style. CS 161 is the introductory course for students planning to major or minor in computer science. A weekly lab is required.

#### Prerequisites
Three years of high-school mathematics, MATH 110 Pre-Calculus, or equivalent. Students with transfer credit for CSCI 161 may not take this course.

#### Required Textbook
[Cay Horstmann. Java Concepts: Early Objects.](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concepts-Cay-S-Horstmann/dp/1119056500)


#### Course Topics
- Computational thinking
- Object-oriented programming
- Arithmetic manipulation
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Methods
- Basic data structures
- Input/output: file and user interaction
- Elementary complexity analysis

#### Student Learning Objectives
After the successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

-  Develop programs that use the fundamental programming constructs: assignment and expressions, basic I/O, conditional and iterative statements.
- Develop programs using functions (methods) with parameter passing.
- Develop programs that create simple classes and instantiate objects of those classes.
- Develop programs that effectively use the different structured data types provided in Java like arrays/lists and maps.
- Develop programs that use file I/O to provide data persistence across multiple executions.
- Develop programs that use language-provided libraries and frameworks (where applicable).
- Write effective comments for a program specifying what it does.

#### Grades
Your overall grade is broken down as as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 5% |
| Lab Assignments | 10% |
| Homework Assignments | 30% |
| Midterm I | 15% |
| Midterm II | 18% |
| Final Exam | 22% |

##### Lab Assignments
Labs provide a low stakes, hands-on, and collaborative way to learn the materials. As such, they only represent 10% of your final grade. You may choose to work alone, or with whomever you like during lab. **However, you must submit your own work.**

For full credit, you must attend weekly labs and submit your lab assignments by the next day. Each lab is worth 2 points, with a simple grading policy:
- On-time attendance + completion (due next day): 2 points
- Late attendance or minimal effort: 1 point
- No-show or no submission: 0 points

Because labs are always due the next day and are graded on attendance and effort, there is no extension for labs. Missing lab is unacceptable. Unless you have excused absences (e.g., athletics, bereavement, medical, etc.), missing over half the lab sessions, will result in an automatic withdrawal or an F for the course.

##### Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are assigned every 1.5 - 2 weeks. Unless otherwise noted, you are to work on homework assignments alone. You are welcome to brainstorm with others (including tutors) for ideas, but any code you submit should be yours.

**Do not copy code you find on the web and/or ChatGPT.** This is considered plagiarism. Please see the "Academic Integrity" section below.
