#### Course Description
This course is an introduction to computer science and programming. The programming language Java is used to illustrate concepts in computer science. The course emphasizes the use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the development of good programming style. CS 161 is the introductory course for students planning to major or minor in computer science. A weekly lab is required.

#### Prerequisites
Three years of high-school mathematics, MATH 110 Pre-Calculus, or equivalent. Students with transfer credit for CSCI 161 may not take this course.

#### Required Textbook
[Cay Horstmann. Java Concepts: Early Objects.](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concepts-Cay-S-Horstmann/dp/1119056500)


#### Course Topics
- Computational thinking
- Object-oriented programming
- Arithmetic manipulation
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Methods
- Basic data structures
- Input/output: file and user interaction
- Elementary complexity analysis


#### CS Community Statement
Students taking this course range from those with no prior background in programming to those with substantial experience and prior coursework. Because this course is an introduction to computer science, I do not expect students to have had any prior experience in programming. The course will work best if we respect and welcome each other no matter what level of "readiness" we are at, and we all support one another in learning. I will not tolerate behaviors that could negatively affect another student’s classroom experience. Such behaviors might include: making rude or condescending comments, snickering at others’ questions or comments, talking over other individuals, and so on. I reserve the right to withdraw a student from this class who is repeatedly exhibiting such behavior.

The goals of this course can only be accomplished in a setting of mutual respect, where ideas, questions, and misconceptions can be discussed with civility. As your instructor, I am committed to creating a classroom environment that welcomes all students, regardless of their identities (e.g., race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs). I firmly believe that everyone in the class is fully capable of engaging and grasping the material, and that the world of computing is stronger when it includes the broadest possible set of perspectives. We all have unconscious biases, and I will try to continually examine my judgments, words, and actions to keep my biases in check and treat everyone fairly. I hope that you will do the same. If you feel comfortable, please let me know if there is anything I can do to make sure everyone is encouraged to succeed in this class.


#### Grading
The following grade cutoffs are upper bounds. They might come down, but will not be set higher: A = 95, A- = 90, B+ = 87, B = 83, B- = 80, C+ = 77, C = 73, C- = 70, D+ = 67, D = 64, D- = 60, F = $<$ 60. Your overall grade will be composed as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 3 |
| Lab Assignments | 10 |
| Homework Assignments | 35 |
| Midterm I | 15 |
| Midterm II | 17 |
| Final Exam | 20 |



##### Late Penalty, Exam Makeup, and Extensions
For each day either a homework assignment is late (including weekends), a $$3^d\%$$ deduction, where $$d$$ is the number of days late, will be assessed. Because ample amounts of time are provided to complete each assignment (usually around 1-2 weeks) no extensions be will given for homework assignments, unless you are experiencing are unique circumstances or for accommodations.
Because labs are always due the next day and are graded on attendance and effort, there is no extension for labs.


##### Exams
There will be two midterms and a final exam. They will cover topics discussed in the lectures, readings from the assigned textbook, and assignments. The exams are cumulative. Study guides are provided and selected problems are reviewed on the lecture preceding the day of the exam. You are allowed a page of notes (front and back) on all exams. 

- Make-up: I expect you to be present on the day of exams. I do not offer make-up exams unless you can demonstrate documented extenuating circumstances. (These do not count: having a minor illness, family visiting, etc.)

- Accommodations: It is *your* responsibility to inform me if you will be taking it at SAA well-ahead of time, so that I have time to get the exams over to their office.

- The following items are prohibited: Phones, headphones, and other mobile devices.


##### Discretionary
Participation points will be given based on:
- Regular lecture and lab attendance
- Classroom participation
- Timeliness
- Refraining from activities that can disrupt others: scrolling through your phone, texting, playing games on your laptop, ...


#### Course Policies

##### No Laptops, No Phones
Laptop computers and other handheld devices are a common distraction during lectures. Except on lab days and for those who can provide documentation of need from the office of SAA, please don't bring your laptops to lectures. Please turn your phones off, or at least put your phones on silent during lecture.

##### Academic Integrity
You should uphold the school's *Student Integrity Code*. Any suspected cheating (plagiarizing code, copying homework solutions, etc.) will be reported to the Registrar, which may result in possible suspension/expulsion and loss of financial aid. See this link in [Student Handbook](https://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/personal-safety/student-handbook/academic-handbook/academic-integrity}{http://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/personal-safety/student-handbook/academic-handbook/academic-integrity) for more info.

##### Student Accessibility and Accommodation (SAA)
If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact Peggy Perno, Director of the Office of Accessibility and Accommodation, 105 Howarth, 253.879.3395. She will determine with you what accommodations are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential.

##### Classroom Emergency Response Guidance
Please review university emergency preparedness and response procedures posted at [https://www.pugetsound.edu/emergency](https://www.pugetsound.edu/emergency). There is a link on the university home page. Familiarize yourself with hall exit doors and the designated gathering area for your class and laboratory buildings.
 
If building evacuation becomes necessary (e.g., earthquake), meet your instructor at the designated gathering area so she/he can account for your presence. Then wait for further instructions. Do not return to the building or classroom until advised by a university emergency response representative.
 
If confronted by an act of violence, be prepared to make quick decisions to protect your safety. Flee the area by running away from the source of danger if you can safely do so. If this is not possible, shelter in place by securing classroom or lab doors and windows, closing blinds, and turning off room lights. Lie on the floor out of sight and away from windows and doors. Place cell phones or pagers on vibrate so that you can receive messages quietly. Wait for further instructions.

##### Student Bereavement Policy
The University of Puget Sound recognizes that a time of bereavement can be difficult for a student. Therefore,  the university provides a Student Bereavement Policy for students facing the loss of a family member. Students are normally eligible for, and faculty members are expected to grant, three consecutive weekdays of excused absences, without penalty, for the death of a family member, including parent, grandparent, sibling, or persons living in the same household. Should the student feel that additional days are necessary, the student must request additional bereavement leave from the Dean of Students or the Dean's designee. In the event of the death of another family member or friend not explicitly included within this policy, a bereaved student may petition for grief absence through the Dean of Students’ office for approval.

##### Student Religious Accommodation
The university provides reasonable religious accommodations for academic courses and programs, and the university policy is found [here](https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/human-resources/policies/campus-policies/student-religious-accommodations-in-academic-courses-or-programs}{https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/human-resources/policies/campus-policies/student-religious-accommodations-in-academic-courses-or-programs).
