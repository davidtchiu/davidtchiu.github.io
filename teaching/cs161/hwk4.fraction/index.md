## CS 161 - Intro to Computer Science

### Homework: Fractions

The key to object oriented programming is to write classes to create objects, then to boss them
around to accomplish a greater goal. In this assignment, you'll get first hand
experience with object interaction, e.g., storing objects and calling methods on them. 

For this assignment, you'll build a class that deals with fractions. Here's an example of object
interaction. For one fraction $$a/b$$ to divide another fraction, you need to first input
another fraction object, say $$c/d$$, that you want to divide with. Then you tell this *other* 
fraction to invert itself to become $$d/c$$. Then you need to ask it for its numerator $$d$$ 
and denominator $$c$$ and multiply them with $$a$$ and $$b$$, respectively. 

For this assignment, you'll build a class that deals with fractions.

#### Student Outcomes

- Exposure to object interaction.
- Exposure to making method calls.
- Exposure to integer divide and type conversion.
- Putting defensive programming into practice.

#### Instructions

For full credit, your class should contain all of the methods described below. They should have exactly the same name as shown, take the correct input arguments, and return the correct information. (I will run a program that creates instances of your class and tests them, and if your names or other details differ, my testing code won't compile.) The assignment is less specific about the instance variables (fields) you'll need â€” you'll have to figure out what you need to store in order to implement the methods below.

#### Constructor and Instance Variables

- Start by creating a new BlueJ project, called `Fraction`. Inside, create a new class called `Fraction`. `Fractions` are simple to model: You just need two instance variables, the numerator and the denominator. They are both integers.

- You need to implement a single constructor, which accepts two integer arguments (its starting numerator and denominator). Store these values into your instance variables. However, the denominator is never allowed to be negative (only the numerator is). If you receive a negative denominator, you *must* turn it positive, but you must also negate the numerator. Once you think you've implemented it properly, you should test it. Try creating a fraction `3/-4`. Does it turn to `-3/4`? What if you tried `-3/-4`? Does the turn the fraction `3/4`?

#### Basic Methods and Testing
We need to provide some methods to our `Fraction`s. Let's start with writing some easier ones.

- Write methods `getNumerator()` and `getDenominator()` that returns the numerator and denominator respectively. That's all they do -- they don't print or do anything else.



- The next method you'll write is called `toString()`. This method accepts no inputs, and it returns a string that represents the current `Fraction` object. Here are some rules you must follow:
  - If the denominator is `1`, then you should just return a string containing the numerator.
  - If the denominator is instead `0`, you need to simply return the string `"undefined"`.
  - If neither of the above cases apply, then you should just return a string `"N/D"` where `N` is the current Fraction's numerator, and `D` is the denominator. For instance, `"-4/11"` would be returned for  the fraction $$\frac{-4}{11}$$.


  You should test this method vigorously before moving on. Sure, you can do things the old way using point-and-click, but it's also about time that we show you how to test in BlueJ's *code pad*. From BlueJ,
  click on the `View` menu and make sure `Show CodePad` is selected. A window pops up on the bottom right corner
  of BlueJ to accept inputs. Type these in line by line. You do not have to include my comments. They are there
  for instruction.

  ```java
  Fraction f = new Fraction(1,8); // create a new fraction object
  System.out.println(f.toString()); // this should print 1/8
  ```

- Here's another simple one. Write a method called `negate()` that negates the numerator. If it's positive, turn it negative. If it's negative, turn it positive. The denominator is untouched. Here's some code to test it in the codepad:

  ```java
  Fraction f = new Fraction(1,3); // create 1/3
  System.out.println(f.toString()); // this should print 1/3
  f.negate();
  System.out.println(f.toString()); // this should print -1/3
  f.negate();
  System.out.println(f.toString()); // this should print 1/3 again!
  ```

- Write a method called `invert()` to exchange its numerator and denominator. This method does not `return` any values.

  ```java
  Fraction f = new Fraction(20,95);
  f.invert();
  System.out.println(f.toString()); // this should now print 95/20
  ```

- We also know that a `Fraction` is *undefined* if its denominator is `0`. Write a method called `isDefined()` that returns `true` or `false` based on whether this fraction is defined.

  ```java
  Fraction f = new Fraction(9,0); // create 9/0
  System.out.println(f.isDefined()); // this should print false
  f.invert();
  System.out.println(f.isDefined()); // this should now print true
  ```

- Sometimes, we're just interested to know what a fraction's decimal (floating-point) representation is. Create a method called `toDouble()` that accepts no inputs and returns the fraction as a `double` value. Now here's the catch -- what's the value if the fraction is undefined? When that is the case, you need to return `Double.NaN` (which stands for Not-a-Number). Beware of integer divide... you will need to *type cast* for this method. For instance:

  ```java
  Fraction f1 = new Fraction(1,4);
  Fraction f2 = new Fraction(1,2);
  System.out.println(f1.toDouble());  // this should print 0.25
  System.out.println(f2.toDouble());  // this should print 0.5

  // since the method returns doubles, we can add them up
  double sum = f1.toDouble() + f2.toDouble();
  System.out.println(sum);  // this should print 0.75
  ```

- Remember our discussion on content (deep) equality? Write a method called `equals()` that accepts *another* `Fraction` object to compare with. This method needs to return true if the two fractions are equal, and false otherwise. Follow these rules. If either `Fraction` is undefined (say, you just wrote that method earlier, and it can be called!) then they can't be equal. If both `Fraction`s are defined, then they are equal when their numerators and denominators agree. To test if they agree, you are going to want to *ask* the `Fraction` you input for its numerator and denominator. Good thing we wrote those "getters" earlier too!

  ```java
  Fraction f1 = new Fraction(2,5);
  Fraction f2 = new Fraction(2,5);
  System.out.println(f1.equals(f2));  // this should print true
  f1.invert();
  System.out.println(f1.equals(f2));  // this should print false
  ```

  Test if your "undefined" checker is working:
  ```java
  Fraction f3 = new Fraction(1,0);  // this is undefined...
  Fraction f4 = new Fraction(1,0);  // this is also undefined... but they're the "same"
  System.out.println(f3.equals(f4));  // this should print false!
  ```

#### Arithmetic Operations
Now we can finally implement add, subtract, multiply, and divide! Before diving in, you must ensure two things:

1. Only the current fraction changes value from calling one of these functions. The *other* fraction that you're adding, subtracting, etc., must remain unchanged.

2. After an operation has been successfully applied, the current fraction should be reduced!

Okay, let's get to writing the last four methods!

- Let's first write `add()`, which accepts a single `Fraction` object to add to the current one. This method does not return a value. If one of the fractions is *undefined*, then take no action. Otherwise, you need to ensure that both fractions' denominators agree. If they already are equal, then simply add the *other* numerator to the current one, and you're done. If they don't agree, then you need to multiply their denominators together. Then multiply the current numerator by the *other* fraction's denominator. Then multiply the other fraction's numerator with the current fraction's denominator and add that sum to your current numerator. 

- Now start working on `minus()`, which accepts a single `Fraction` object to subtract from the current one. You can go about this in similar fashion to `add()`, and that's totally fine, but do you need to do all that work again? Isn't subtraction just adding a fraction that's been  *negated*?

- Write `multiply()`, which is likely the easiest of the bunch. Simply multiply the numerators and denominators together with the given `Fraction`. This method, like all the others, does not return a value.

- Finally, to do divide two `Fraction`s you need to first invert the *other* one. Then multiply them together. (There's a reason I had to implement `multiply()` first!)

#### Reduced Form (Need to Loop)

A fraction should always be in *reduced form*. For instance 6/8 reduces to 3/4 and 16/18 reduces to 25/1000 reduces to 1/40. An important step towards finding the reduced form is to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) between two integers, that is, we need to find the largest positive integer that divides evenly into two integers. 

- Write a method called `gcd()` that inputs two integers `a` and `b`. We'll use the famous Euclidean Algorithm. You need to write the following loop: as long as `a` is not `b`, test if `a` is larger than `b`. If so, subtract `b` from `a`. However, if `a` was not larger than `b`, then subtract `a` from `b`. This loop is guaranteed to terminate. Once it does, return `a`. Test it out. The GCD between 6 and 8 is 2 and the GCD between 25 and 1000 is 25. Test more cases.

- Now we're ready to write `reduce()`. It does not input anything and it does not return a value. To perform a reduction of a fraction, you simply need to divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD. 

  ```java
  Fraction f1 = new Fraction(4,8);
  f1.reduce();
  System.out.println(f1.toString()); // this should print 1/2, since gcd(4,8) == 4.

  Fraction f2 = new Fraction(27,9);
  f2.reduce();
  System.out.println(f2.toString()); // this should print 3/1, since gcd(27, 9) == 9.
  ```

- Because `gcd()` should only be called in another method of this class, we should make it `private` instead of `public`. 



#### Program Defensively

You can't control how another user or program chooses to use your methods. For each method, think critically about all the things that could go wrong and cause an unintended result (e.g., a runtime error, infinite loop/recursion, etc.). Chances are, I'll be trying all kinds of inputs (negative values, zeroes, nulls, empty-strings, etc.) when I grade your program. The mark of a good programmer is one that can anticipate such scenarios ahead of time and ensure that their program handles all sorts of errors gracefully.

#### Commenting

Each and every method should have a "javadoc-style" comment above it (the ones that use `/* ... */`). For full credit, you should use the @param and @return tags as appropriate in these method comments. Each instance variable (field) should have a brief comment as well. Don't forget the main comment at the top of the class either - I'm looking for more than just a sentence or two.
