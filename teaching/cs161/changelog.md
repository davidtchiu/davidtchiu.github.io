#### TODO
- Consider getting rid of the book altogether now, but some students actually say they read it.
- Do I need an encyclopedia of syntax?
- Hwk 3 needs to be due sooner (2 days -- to Monday of week 6)
- In last week, where do we go after this course?
  - Want to minor or major? CS 261, Math 210
  - PHIL - Ethics in AI
  - CONN 350: Modeling Earth's Climate
  - Asian Language & Culture - Take a course or two in Chinese, Japanese, or ALC
  - Courses in STHS
  - Apply for a position in Tech Services
- I should do a small unit on debugging and hand out rubber ducks sooner. BlueJ debugger tool. Problems like reverse(), edge cases, removing items from a list, ...
  - I'd have to cut hashmap. Not a huge deal if I do.
- Start teaching `if (5 == x)` instead of `(x == 5)`. A debugging lab?
- Move static/enum/private/public up (or spread them out)
