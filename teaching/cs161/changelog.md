#### TODO

- Why have students create a new zip every time? Just submit the `.java` files.
- Switch to non-`this` again.
- Use instance variables instead of fields
- Push back return. Don't really use it until CircleDrawer lab 5 and object interaction
- Start teaching `if (5 == x)` instead of `(x == 5)`. A debugging lab?
- Consider moving complexity before design
- Need a better lab 2. It stinks. Maybe have them start manipulating Circle with some scope stuff thrown in
- Hwk 4 lot cooler if I introduced an Arm class or somethingâ€¦
