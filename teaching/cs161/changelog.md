#### TODO
- Grading: Model rubric off 261
- Move static/enum/private/public up (or spread them out)
- Put starter code on github
- Spring: Exam 2 move to Week 12, not 13
- Why have students create a new zip every time? Just submit the `.java` files.
- Push back return. We don't _really_ use it until CircleDrawer lab 5 and object interaction
- Start teaching `if (5 == x)` instead of `(x == 5)`. A debugging lab?
- Consider moving complexity before design
- Need a better lab 2. It stinks. Maybe have them start manipulating Circle with some scope stuff thrown in
- Hwk 4 lot cooler if I introduced an Arm class or something…
