#### Course Description
The management of data is one of the classical problems in computing. This course centers around the fundamental concepts and theory behind the relational data model, which addresses numerous problems that plague data management, including data independence, access, consistency, and information loss. Course topics include the relational data model, database languages (e.g., SQL), relational database theory, database design (by decomposition), query execution, and considerations that affect system performance. Students will design database schemas that effectively model an organization's information and write applications that require database integration. Students will also gain insight through the implementation of influential data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in modern relational database systems.

#### Prerequisites
A grade of C- or higher in the following course is required, or with permission from the instructor:
- CSCI 261: Computer Science II
- MATH 210: The Mathematics of Computer Science

#### Required Textbook
[Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan, Database System Concepts. 7th Ed.](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Concepts-Sudarshan-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/B0B8528T3H/)


#### Course Topics
- The Relational Model
- Relational Algebra and SQL
- Relational Database Theory and Normalization
- Performance Analysis
- Database File Organization
- Hashing and Indexing
- Transactions and Concurrency Control



#### Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Describe the defining characteristics behind the relational data model.
- Analyze user requirements to prepare an appropriate relational database schema.
- Compose SQL queries that incorporate select, project, join, union, intersection, set difference, and
set division.
- Use normal forms and perform normalization in the design of a relational database.
- Analyze and solve problems related to external memory data structures and algorithms using suitable mathematics.
- Evaluate the merits among various file organization and indexing designs, with respect to space and time complexity.
- Design, code, test and debug programs which perform query and update transactions on a database in a team-based environment.

#### Grades
Your overall grade is broken down as as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 7% |
| Term Project | 15% |
| Homework Assignments | 25% |
| Midterm I | 15% |
| Midterm II | 18% |
| Final Exam | 20% |


##### Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are a mix of paper-based and coding-based. They account for a significant portion of the final grade.  Unless otherwise noted, you are to work on homework assignments alone. You are welcome to brainstorm with others (including tutors) for ideas, but any code you submit should be yours.

**Do not copy code you find on the web and/or ChatGPT.** This is considered plagiarism. Please see the "Academic Integrity" section below.


##### Term Project
There will be an open-ended group project assigned about mid-way through the course. The most successful teams meet and physically work together at an agreed-upon location and time -- that is, *uno animo*. It is a good idea to set up version control environments and practice scrum, to ensure everyone has something to do and is making progress. A final presentation will be given toward the end of the semester. Each member of the team should contribute equally to the assignment. Students on the same team may receive different grades based on perceived effort and contributions (via scrum logs and git commit history).
