# TODO
- There's a lot (too much?) exam 1 practice, between the labs, Hwk, and RGs. How to better balance?
- Redo the study guides so that the topics are listed
- Hwk 3: be clear that ENG=>ENGL is the only replacement? Or remove it. Be clear that no illegal insert statement shall be generated!
- Hwk 5: Don't give powerSet? The .jar file isn't working for anyone.
- Still not doing a good enough job explaining what the 3rd property of 3NF does to include the Dep-preserving relations. Work out a proof using cover Fc
