# TODO
- Need to update board work for theory
- Hwk 1: Remove Q2 (too obvious from Q1)
- Hwk 2: Split up last page for more room. Do away with Q6
- Don't put off labs until the end. Make one lab go sooner. Make an easier lab for day 1, then make the current lab shorter.
- There's a lot (too much?) exam 1 practice, between the labs, Hwk, and RGs. How to better balance?
  - Make SQL lab into work days for the Hwk 4
  - Hwk 4 => Car models? Univ with harder questions?
- Redo the study guides so that the topics are listed

# Change Log
- Make car models into Hwk 4; Make peoplesoft into Lab (6/22)
- Project converted to being more open-ended (6/22)
- Add 3NF and dependency preserving to lectures (6/22)
- Normalization homework converted to programming: FD closure (hwk 5) + BCNF (hwk 6) (5/22)
