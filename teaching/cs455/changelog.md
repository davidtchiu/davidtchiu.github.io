# TODO
- Hwk 1: Remove Q2 (too obvious from Q1)
- Hwk 2: Split up last page for more room. Do away with Q6
- Don't put off labs until the end. Make one lab go sooner. Make an easier lab for day 1, then make the current lab shorter.
- There's a lot (too much?) exam 1 practice, between the labs, Hwk, and RGs. How to better balance?
  - Make SQL lab into work days for the Hwk 4
  - Hwk 4 => Car models? Univ with harder questions?
- Redo the study guides so that the topics are listed
- Hwk 3: be clear that ENG=>ENGL is the only replacement? Or remove it. Be clear that no illegal insert statement shall be generated!
- Hwk 5: Don't give powerSet?
- Still not doing a good enough job explaining what the 3rd property of 3NF does to include the DP relations. Work out a proof using cover Fc
