### Biosketch

I'm a Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="https://pugetsound.edu/mathematics-computer-science-current-student">University of Puget Sound</a>, where I also served a 3-year term as department chair from 2019-22. I am currently the Faculty Advisor to the university's <a href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/living-learning-communities/students-color-residential-community">Students of Color Residential Community</a>.

  I received a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://cse.osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a> as a member of the <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/research/systems">Systems Group</a>. I studied under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kOUPR1sAAAAJ&hl=en">Gagan Agrawal</a> (now Associate Dean at Augusta) and worked on problems in the dynamic composition, performance modeling, and optimizations of scientific workflows over distributed cloud computing environments. Prior to Ohio State, I studied under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_S._Wang">Paul S. Wang</a> at the Institute of Computational Mathematics (ICM/Kent State) on the transmission of mathematics education modules for my BS/MS degrees. My current teaching and research interests span database management, distributed cloud computing, and the web. I am a member of ACM and a senior member of the IEEE.
