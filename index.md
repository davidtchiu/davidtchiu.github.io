Associate Professor and Chair of Computer Science, University of Puget Sound

### Biosketch
I am an Associate Professor and Chair of Computer Science at the University of Puget Sound. I completed a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University as a member of the High-Performance Systems Group. I studied under the supervision of Gagan Agrawal. My dissertation topic was on the dynamic composition and performance optimizations of scientific workflows over distributed cloud computing environments. I also worked on problems in cloud data management.

I am the recipient of the 2017 Kristine Bartanen Research Achievement Award from the University of Puget Sound. My current teaching and research interests broadly include data management and distributed cloud computing. I am a member of ACM and senior member of the IEEE.

Here's a link to my curriculum vitae.
