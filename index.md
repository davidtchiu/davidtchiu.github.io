### Biosketch

I am an Associate Professor and Chair of Computer Science at the [University of Puget Sound](https://pugetsound.edu/mathematics-computer-science-current-students). Prior to joining Puget Sound, I was on the faculty at Washington State University, Vancouver. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu) as a member of the [Systems Group](https://cse.osu.edu/research/systems). At Ohio State, I worked under the supervision of [Gagan Agrawal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kOUPR1sAAAAJ&hl=en), and my dissertation was on the dynamic composition, performance modeling, and optimizations of scientific workflows over distributed cloud computing environments. I also worked on (and continue to work on) problems involving cloud data management. Before that, I worked under [Paul S. Wang](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~pwang/) at ICM/Kent State for my BS and MS degrees.

My current teaching and research interests include data management and distributed cloud computing. I am a member of ACM and senior member of the IEEE.

Here's a link to my [curriculum vitae](CV.pdf).
