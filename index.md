### Biosketch

I am an Associate Professor and Chair of Computer Science at the [University of Puget Sound](https://pugetsound.edu). Prior to joining Puget Sound, I completed a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu) as a member of the [High-Performance Systems Group](https://cse.osu.edu/research/systems) and under the supervision of [Gagan Agrawal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kOUPR1sAAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral dissertation was on the dynamic composition and performance optimizations of scientific workflows over distributed cloud computing environments. I also worked on (and continue to work on) problems involving cloud data management and indexing. Prior to my PhD, I worked under [Paul S. Wang](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~pwang/) for my BS and MS degrees.

My current teaching and research interests include data management and distributed cloud computing. I am a member of ACM and senior member of the IEEE.

Here's a link to my [curriculum vitae](CV.pdf).
